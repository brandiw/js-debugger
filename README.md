# Debugging JavaScript with Chrome Dev Tools

## Objective

By the end of this assignment you will be able to:
- Open the Chrome Developer Tools
- Set a breakpoint in your JavaScript code
- Read and interpret errors in the Console
- Demonstrate how to inspect an HTML element and view its box model
- Show an emulation of how a webpage looks on a mobile browser

(Prepare to demo these skills in class!)

## Your task

- Fork and clone this repository
- Type `npm install` to load up browsersync
- use `npm start` to initiate browsersync
- Read carefully through index.html for directions on how to complete your assignment
- Debug the debug.js file as instructed. 
    - Your console will be free of any JS errors at the end!
- After you've debugged the JS, push the changes to your forked repository
- From your GitHub repository, create a pull request against the original

## Further Resources

- The [Google Developers Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw) has tons of resources about the Dev Tools (I like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI) in particular as a guide to some dev tool shortcuts).
