#Debugging JavaScript with Chrome Dev Tools

##Objective

By the end of this assignment you will be able to:
- Open the Chrome Developer Tools
- Set a breakpoint in your JavaScript code
- Read and interpret errors in the Console
- Demonstrate how to inspect an HTML element and view its box model
- Show an emulation of how a webpage looks on a mobile browser

(Prepare to demo these skills in class!)

##Your task

- Fork and clone this repository
- use NPM Start to initiate browser sync.
- Read through index.html
- Debug the debug.js file as instructed. (Your console will be free of any JS errors at the end)
- After you've debugged the JS, push the changes to your forked repository
- From your GitHub repository, create a pull request against the original

###Helpful hints

- If you get stuck, work with a partner
- Ask for help via our Slack channel
- Review past notes on the [course website](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wdi_sea/notes/details)
- Go to the [Google Developers Website](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/) for more in depth instructions of the things the debugger and dev tools can do.

###Further Resources

- The [Google Developers Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw) has tons of resources about the Dev Tools (I like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI) in particular as a guide to some dev tool shortcuts).
